        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <p>this is one that is well known and by far is the hardest to prevent becauese if someone thinks that thay have nothing left to loos and will end ther one life thay might be harder to talk to 
            <br><br>
            ok so the beter way to do it is find what caused it if it was from a tramatic stress thay might need perfeshanal help as you cant do much
            <br><br>
            the second thing is thinking thay have nothing left be with them at all times and try to do that with everything to show that the world has more to offer.
            <br><br>
            if its becuse of sycosis or insomia forcing them to remember false memorys thar are hundereds of medicashons to help this shold be talk over with a doctor.
            <br><br>
            if thay lost a family member thain repeit step one.
